# AI-Native Company Bootcamp — Five-Day Program

## Who This Program Is For

This program is designed for founders with an idea—technical or non-technical—who want to build AI-Native companies from day one. It targets early teams at the pre-product, pre-seed, and pre-PMF stage who have clarity about a problem space but have not yet validated or tested their ideas.

## Stage of Companies

Participants are typically early-stage: pre-product, pre-revenue, and sometimes pre-incorporation. They come with an idea or problem area in mind but little formal validation, no prototype, and no established customer base. The program meets them at the earliest possible moment and accelerates them toward a credible AI-Native plan and prototype.

## What Outcomes Founders Should Achieve

By the end of the week, founders will have a validated problem and ICP, a first-pass AI system design, a functional prototype, an initial GTM direction, an AI operations blueprint, and a realistic economic model. These components come together as the **AI-Native Company Blueprint™**—a concise, investor-ready articulation of what they are building, why it matters, how it works, and how it will scale.

## Program Promise

Founders leave with clarity, evidence, and momentum: a sharper understanding of their users, a tested value hypothesis, a working AI interaction, and a narrative grounded in real economics. The bootcamp gives them the confidence and capability to move from a rough idea to a credible AI-Native startup in five days.

## Pre-Work Requirements

Before arriving at the bootcamp, all founders must complete:

- **5 Customer Discovery Interviews:** Documented conversations with potential users in your problem space
- **Interview Summary Template:** Key pain points, current workflows, and willingness to pay indicators
- **Problem Space Brief:** 1-page overview of the problem area you're exploring (not the solution)
- **Team Assessment:** Current team composition and identified skill gaps
- **Competitive Landscape Scan:** Identify 5-10 existing solutions (traditional and AI-Native) in your problem space

This pre-work ensures Day 1 starts with real user insights rather than assumptions, maximizing the value of the intensive five-day program.

## Key Program Principles

### 1. Evidence Over Theory
Every session produces tangible artifacts. No concept is discussed without immediate application to the founder's specific problem.

### 2. AI-Native, Not AI-Enhanced
The program consistently distinguishes between adding AI features to traditional products versus building companies where AI fundamentally transforms the value proposition.

### 3. Workflow-First Thinking
Solutions start with deep workflow understanding, not technology capabilities. AI is the means, not the end.

### 4. Economic Realism
Unit economics, margin engineering, and cost modeling are embedded throughout—not afterthoughts. Founders confront the hard math of AI companies early.

### 5. Cascading Outputs
Each day's output becomes the next day's input. The IOOI loop (Input → Output → Outcome → Insight) ensures nothing is theoretical or disconnected.

### 6. Operational Readiness
Founders don't just build prototypes—they understand monitoring, evaluation, compliance, team needs, and the ongoing operational reality of AI systems.

### 7. Investor-Ready by Day 5
The program culminates in a complete, fundable narrative backed by evidence: validated problem, working prototype, operational plan, and realistic economics.

### 8. Risk Transparency
Model risk, vendor dependencies, ethical considerations, and regulatory requirements are addressed head-on, not glossed over. Founders learn to build resilient AI businesses.

### 9. Competitive Honesty
The program forces founders to answer the hard questions: Why won't OpenAI build this? Why can't competitors replicate this in 3 months? What's actually defensible?

### 10. Team Reality
Building AI companies requires specific talent. The program helps founders understand exactly what roles they need, how to hire for them, and what they'll cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I don't have a technical co-founder?**
A: Day 4 includes dedicated team building sessions to help you identify exactly what technical skills you need, how to evaluate candidates, and strategies for finding co-founders or early technical hires. Many successful AI companies started with non-technical founders who learned to recruit and evaluate technical talent effectively.

**Q: What if my prototype doesn't work by Day 3?**
A: That's exactly the point. Failure modes are learning opportunities. The "When AI Fails" workshop is designed around real failure—we document what broke, why, and how to design around it. A "failed" prototype that teaches you critical constraints is more valuable than a polished demo that hides problems.

**Q: How technical do I need to be?**
A: Non-technical founders succeed by focusing on problem validation, workflow design, GTM strategy, and learning to evaluate AI capabilities. Technical founders go deeper on architecture and implementation. Both paths are valid—we meet you where you are.

**Q: What if my industry has complex compliance requirements?**
A: Day 2 includes a compliance-architecture checkpoint, and Day 4 does a regulatory deep-dive. We've worked with founders in healthcare, finance, legal, and education—all heavily regulated. You'll leave with a clear compliance roadmap.

**Q: Will this help me raise funding?**
A: The AI-Native Company Blueprint™ is explicitly designed to be investor-ready. You'll have validation evidence, working prototype, realistic economics, and a narrative that educates investors on why your approach is defensible. Many bootcamp graduates go directly into fundraising conversations.

**Q: What if AI models get much better/cheaper during my development?**
A: Day 5's Model Risk & Resilience Planning addresses exactly this. You'll build economic models with sensitivity analysis and learn to design architectures that benefit from model improvements rather than being disrupted by them.

**Q: Is this only for B2B companies?**
A: No. The framework works for B2B, B2C, and marketplace models. The core principles—workflow transformation, data moats, economic realism—apply across business models.

**Q: What if I'm already building but feel stuck?**
A: The bootcamp works for early-stage founders who've started building but need clarity on defensibility, economics, or GTM. Day 1's validation work will either confirm your direction or help you pivot based on evidence.

**Q: How is this different from other AI accelerators?**
A: Most programs teach AI concepts. We engineer fundable AI-Native companies through structured IOOI loops that produce tangible artifacts daily. You leave with a working prototype and complete blueprint, not just knowledge.
