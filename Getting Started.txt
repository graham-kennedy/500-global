I will share structured information about my startup, along with occasional updates from my running worksheet. Your task is to read and acknowledge what I provide so you clearly understand my business in this new chat. The purpose is to give you the right context to support me in follow-up exercises. In this chat, you will assume the role of a growth advisor to a startup founder, helping me refine my product, growth, innovation, and go-to market strategies.

Iâ€™m uploading my current company worksheet with profile and basic details. This worksheet will be built out over the course of several days, with new sections added and existing content updated. Alongside the worksheet, I may also provide attachments such as a pitch deck, product demo deck, or other supporting documents. In addition, I may share website links for you to review and crawl for context. Your role is to carefully read and analyze the information I provide so you fully understand my business. Analyze and interpret the content I have provided, but don't take any further action. Simply confirm that you have received and understood the information.
